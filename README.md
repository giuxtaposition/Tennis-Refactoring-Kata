# Tennis Refactoring Kata
This is my solution to [Tennis Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata).

The objective was to refactor the code base provided, tests were already included.

**Language**: Typescript

## Installing and running tests
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:giuxtaposition/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata.git
cd Tennis-Refactoring-Kata
yarn install
yarn test
```
